This repository was created to show some of my personal codes.

PhpDataGridView = generic DataGridView in PHP that accepted any kind of object - using jqGrid as the front-end. It was requested for a colleague to help him out in the development of one of the screens he was working on for the Administration of an E-commerce. It allows you to add, edit, view, sort and delete rows of information.
